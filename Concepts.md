### Locals in terraform

A local value assigns a name to an expression, so you can use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating the expression.
A Local is only accessible within the local module vs a Terraform variable which can be scoped globally. Another thing to note is that a local in Terraform doesnâ€™t change its value once assigned. A variable value can be manipulated via expressions. ]
